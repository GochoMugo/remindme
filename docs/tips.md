# useful tips

* Secure your `~/.remindme` properly, by making it writable by
  your user only.

  {% highlight bash %}
  $ chmod u=rw ~/.remindme
  {% endhighlight %}

* You can synchronize your remindme data files across multiple
  computers using [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup). See
  this [gist](https://gist.github.com/GochoMugo/643dcd4a0eefb016d689) for
  less instructions.
